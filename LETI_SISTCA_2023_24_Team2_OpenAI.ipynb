    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will present an API developed by openAI, one of the leading organisations in\n",
    "artificial intelligence (AI) research and development. Launched in 2020, it represents a significant\n",
    "milestone in accessing advanced AI technology. It offers an accessible and simplified interface for\n",
    "developers to integrate AI capabilities into a variety of applications, from text analysis to content\n",
    "generation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI API is based on recent advances in machine learning, in particular, deep neural\n",
    "network architectures, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. These\n",
    "models have revolutionised the way machines understand and generate natural language, enabling\n",
    "tasks such as automatic translation, text summarising, question answering, and content generation.\n",
    "GPT is trained with a vast amount of textual data from the internet, allowing it to capture the\n",
    "nuances and complexities of human language. Through the pre-training process, the model learns\n",
    "to represent knowledge in a general way, without the need for specific training for a particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI API leverages these pre-trained language models, providing a simple and effec-\n",
    "tive interface for developers to take advantage of their capabilities. This means users can easily\n",
    "integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications, without needing to understand complex\n",
    "implementation details or model training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is designed with a focus on security and ethics, including measures to prevent\n",
    "malicious or harmful use of AI technology. This reflects OpenAI’s commitment to promoting\n",

    "curricular unit or in other contexts, the OpenAI API offers a versatile and robust environment to\n",
    "explore the potential of artificial intelligence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing this topic, the need to familiarise yourself not only with the fundamental con-\n",
    "cepts of artificial intelligence, but also with the practical tools for its implementation, is recognised.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This required not only mastering theoretical principles, but also exploring accessible programming\n",
    "languages and platforms such as the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this article is to explore the various features offered by the OpenAI API\n",
    "and learn how to integrate them, promoting a comprehensive and practical understanding of the\n",
    "platform’s capabilities, providing users with a solid foundation to explore and use the following\n",
    "available tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chat Completions**: To understand the generic implementation of a chat-based GPT assistant.\n",
    "- **Assistants API + Tools**: Create a program that provides users with media suggestions such as books, films, or TV shows.\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Learn how to represent words, sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents in a continuous vector space.\n",

    "# 2 Theoretical (scientific/technological background)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into specific AI models it’s important to have a general understanding of how AI\n",
    "generally works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most AI models are based on broader Large language models (LLMs) these are algorithms\n",
    "that have been trained on vast amounts of data with the purpose of understanding and generating\n",
    "human like text. LLMs make use of the transformer type of architecture, a deep learning tech-\n",
    "nique that, in short, represents text via numerical representations known as tokens and gives them\n",
    "different weights so as to be able to contextualise words and find similarities [1].  \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of a transformer based model is the Generative pre-trained transformer\n",
    "(GPT), an AI model that has been pre-trained on large sets of data via the use of the transformer\n",
    "architecture for general purpose tasks. Furthermore, these models can be fine tuned to achieve\n",
    "greater performance in more specific tasks, such is the case of image generation models [2].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in order to make use of these models it’s essential to understand the concept of prompts.\n",
    "That is the name given to the textual inputs given to the model. These inputs are then broken\n",
    "down into the aforementioned tokens via a process we call tokenization, which facilitates the use\n",
    "of the models language structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 State-of-the-art\n",
    "\n",
    "AI, Artificial Intelligence, refers to a simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed\n",
    "to mimic human cognitive processes and actions. The concept of AI is not new, it has been around\n",
    "since the mid-20th century, but in the last few years there have been significant advances for AI.\n",
    "With these advances, due to its potential, AI has become increasingly important across various\n",
    "industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education, amongst others. Nowadays, one\n",
    "of the most famous companies developing AI products is OpenAI, which we are going to base\n",
    "our work on. However, just like any other business, OpenAI has its competitors. Some of them\n",

    "\n",
    "OpenAI’s API offers a vast array of cutting-edge AI models based on deep learning and natural\n",
    "language processing techniques. These models have been trained on vast datasets and fine tuned\n",
    "to fulfil a variety of tasks such as text and image generation, audio and text conversions, amongst\n",
    "other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series is OpenAI’s main set of large language\n",
    "models. These models are trained to understand and generate natural language text based on\n",
    "contextual inputs so as to better communicate with humans. The most widespread version, GPT-\n",
    "3.5 currently serves as the model that powers the free version of ChatGPT. Its understanding\n",
    "of human language allows for coherent conversations which makes it a suitable chat bot. GPT-4\n",
    "improves upon its predecessor with a smarter and more knowledgeable model that provides greater\n",
    "accuracy across various tasks. In particular, GPT-4 introduces Vision as a new feature, that enables\n",
    "it to process image inputs, making it useful in a wider range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function calling\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT based models are capable of calling previously specified functions in response to user\n",
    "actions or prompts by calling external APIs to retrieve data or to automate procedures like sending\n",
    "an email or extracting and sorting data from a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI Assistants functionality leverages the use of the GPT models alongside function calling\n",
    "and other tools like file retrieval and code interpreter to allow users to create custom assistants\n",
    "that fulfil more specific tasks based on the provided instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2  Other models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DALL-E\n",
    "\n",
    "The DALL-E model is capable of generating images from natural-language text descriptions, as\n",
    "well as modifying existing ones by feeding the model instructions from a text prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TTS\n",
    "\n",
    "The Text-To-Speech model is capable of converting text into a natural sounding speech. Note\n",
    "that it currently only supports the English language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whisper\n",
    "\n",
    "Whisper does the opposite of the TTS model: it takes an audio input and then transcribes it\n",
    "into text. Unlike text to speech, Whisper is capable of understanding multiple languages, as such\n",
    "it can be used to identify the input language and translate the contents of the speech into English.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Text embeddings are vectorial representations of strings of text, such as words or phrases. By\n",
    "comparing two or more vectors we can infer their similarity. This mechanism is highly useful in\n",
    "applications such as search engines or product recommendations due to it’s ability of evaluating\n",
    "similarity between text strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI’s Moderation model is designed to verify if a certain piece of text includes any content\n",
    "that could be classified as hateful, violent, sexual, harmful or otherwise inappropriate. Whilst\n",
    "OpenAI’s own use of the model aims to ensure that content complies with their usage policies [3],\n",
