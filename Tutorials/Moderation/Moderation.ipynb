    "* *__Hate__* - Content that expresses or promotes hatred based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status or caste. Hateful content directed at unprotected groups constitutes harassment.\n",
    "* *__Hate/Threatening__* - Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste.\n",
    "* *__Harassment__* - Content that expresses, incites, or promotes harassing language towards any target.\n",
    "* *__Harassment/Threatening__* - Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target.\n",
    "* *__Self-harm__* - Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.\n",
    "* *__Self-harm/Intent__* - Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.\n",
    "* *__Self-harm/Instructions__* - Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts.\n",
    "* *__Sexual__* - Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness).\n",
    "* *__Sexual/Minors__* - Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old.\n",
    "* *__Violence__* - Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury.\n",
    "* *__Violence/Graphic__* - Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury in graphic detail.\n",
