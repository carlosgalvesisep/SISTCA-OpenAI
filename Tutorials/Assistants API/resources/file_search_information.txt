Tim Bergling (Swedish: [ˈtɪmː ˈbæ̂rjlɪŋ] ⓘ; 8 September 1989 – 20 April 2018), known professionally as Avicii (/əˈviːtʃi/ ə-VEE-chee, Swedish: [aˈvɪ̌tːɕɪ]), was a Swedish DJ and music producer. At age 16, he began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal.[2] He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top 10 in more than 15 countries and topped international charts;[3][4][5][6] the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States.

In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci (01).[7] His catalog also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You", and "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012[8] and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s.[9][10]

Bergling retired from touring in 2016, after several years of stress and poor mental health.[11] On 20 April 2018, he died by suicide while on holiday in Muscat, Oman. In 2019, his third and final album, Tim, was released posthumously.[12]
Life and career
1989–2010: Early life and career

Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989,[13] the son of Klas Bergling, who ran an office supply business, and actress Anki Lidén.[14] He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, and actor Anton Körberg. He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight.[15]

Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16,[16] teaching himself to use a pirated copy of FL Studio.[14] In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label.[17] He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style.[18] By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu" and "Even". Bergling explained that the name Avicii means "the lowest level of Buddhist hell" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page.[19][20] Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in several countries, including Belgium,[21] France,[22] the Netherlands,[23] United Kingdom,[24] and Sweden.[25] He also remixed Nadia Ali's classic single "Rapture" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.[26]
2011–2013: "Levels"
Avicii at the Inox Festival in September 2011

In 2011, Bergling's track "Fade into Darkness" was sampled by Leona Lewis on her single "Collide". The sampling was not accredited and led to controversy as Bergling attempted to block the single's release. The matter was resolved out of court, with "Collide" being made a joint release between Lewis and Bergling.[27] In October 2011, Bergling released "Levels", which launched him into the mainstream. "Levels" reached the top ten in Austria,[28] Belgium,[29] Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Denmark,[30] Finland,[31] Germany,[32] Greece, Ireland,[33] Italy,[34] the Netherlands,[35] Slovenia and the United Kingdom,[36] whilst topping the charts in Hungary,[37] Norway[38] and Sweden.[39]

In 2012, his collaboration track "Sunshine" with David Guetta was nominated for a Grammy award under the category for Best Dance Recording.[8] On 23 March 2012, Bergling's unsigned single "Last Dance" was previewed on Pete Tong's show on BBC Radio 1.[40] The song was later released on 27 August 2012. At Ultra Music Festival 2012 in Miami, he premiered two tracks, "Girl Gone Wild" (Avicii's UMF Remix) with Madonna[41] and "Superlove" with Lenny Kravitz.[42] Bergling's UMF Remix of "Girl Gone Wild" was released on 20 April 2012, and "Superlove" with Kravitz was released on 29 May 2012. After reaching two million followers on Facebook, Bergling released a new song titled "Two Million". It was put out as a free download on his official SoundCloud page. On 27 April 2012, Bergling released "Silhouettes". The song featured vocals from Salem Al Fakir and peaked at number 5 on the UK Dance charts[43] and number 4 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs.[44]

Bergling was a featured performer on 4 August 2012 at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park.[45] On 12 August 2012, he released "Dancing in My Head" (Avicii's 'Been Cursed' Mix) on Beatport.[46] The track features vocals from Eric Turner. A radio edit of the track, titled "Dancing in My Head" (Tom Hangs Mix) was released on 14 August 2012 on iTunes, and a remix EP was later released on 30 October 2012 featuring remixes from Charlie Bernardo and Michael Woods. On 26 September 2012, Bergling made history as the first DJ to headline the world-famous Radio City Music Hall in New York City.[47] He performed two sold-out shows on 26 and 27 September. He was supported by Matt Goldman and Cazzette at the two shows. At his Radio City Music Hall shows, he played a preview of his new track with Mike Posner titled "Stay with You".[48]

Artistry
Influences
Daft Punk (top) and Swedish House Mafia (bottom) were both influences on Avicii's music.

Bergling's influences included Basshunter,[159] Daft Punk, Swedish House Mafia, and Eric Prydz.[160] He described his introduction to electronic music as "listening to a lot of Daft Punk, way before I knew what house music was".[161]
Musical style

Bergling's early work was deep house and progressive house, usually based on a four-chord structure, sub-bass and a simple synth melody.[2] His debut studio album True featured a blending of music genres, including folktronica.[162] While making the album, Bergling wanted to fuse the electronic music genre with soul, funk, blues, folk and country, as he felt that EDM had become too focused on "dirty drops".[163] Its first single, "Wake Me Up", is a folk music crossover, which, as noted by Katie Bain of The Observer, "tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated".[164] A Variety editor commented that Bergling's "distinct sound" was made up of "soaring synths and keening melodies".[162] Musicians such as Kygo, Skrillex, Diplo, Gryffin, Martin Garrix and Cheat Codes have cited him as a source of inspiration.[165]
Philanthropy

After achieving widespread commercial success, Bergling began working with his manager and executive producer Arash Pournouri to start House for Hunger in 2011,[166] a charity dedicated to alleviating global hunger. The pair wanted to showcase the giving spirit fostered by the house music community. Bergling explained, "You have to give something back. I am so fortunate to be in the position where I can actually do that. I feel lucky every day when I wake up and am able to do what I love and make a living." In addition to donating $1 million to Feeding America, a charity founded by John van Hengel, House for Hunger has helped fund the efforts of The Feed Foundation, started by Laura Bush,[167] allowing it to distribute over 2 million school meals throughout Africa.[168] He also supported campaigns against human trafficking and gang violence when he directed the videos for his tracks "For a Better Day" and "Pure Grinding".[169]
Personal life

Bergling enjoyed playing World of Warcraft in his youth. He developed anxiety at a young age,[14][151] with his parents taking him to a therapist at the age of 14.[14]
Relationships

From 2011 to 2013, Bergling dated Emily Goldberg, an American student who died on 3 April 2024.[170] He then dated Racquel Bettencourt, a Canadian student and model; they lived together in California before splitting up in late 2014. At the time of his death, he was dating Tereza Kacerova, a model; they had decided to keep their relationship private.[14]
Health

In January 2012, Bergling was hospitalised for 11 days in New York City with acute pancreatitis caused by excessive alcohol use.[14][171] Between 2012 and 2014, Bergling was prescribed opioids for the pain caused by his pancreatitis, including OxyContin and Vicodin, to which he developed an addiction. In 2014, Bergling underwent surgery and had both his appendix and gallbladder removed. In 2015, Bergling entered a rehab facility, later announcing in March 2016 that he would be retiring from touring.[14] In the 2017 documentary Avicii: True Stories, directed by his close and longtime collaborator Levan Tsikurishvili, Bergling spoke about his physical and mental health struggles. The documentary depicts the pressure from his management to continue performing live in spite of his objections.[172]

Following his retirement, Bergling took up transcendental meditation, which he credited with reducing his anxiety, and started seeing a therapist.[151]

High pressure from management and fans to continue touring and maintaining his public persona were cited as key reasons for his suicide, according to GQ. In a statement from the article, "Bergling feared upsetting fans. He was sensitive to the 'flood of hate mail' after cancelled gigs."[173]

His manager, Arash Pournouri, admitted that he knew of Bergling's anxieties but refused to label them a problem of mental health. Furthermore, his management team only became aware of his painkiller addiction in November 2014. They staged two interventions for him, neither of which were successful. Pournouri rescheduled many shows in order for Bergling to recover in Stockholm. Having discovered his client's alcohol issues earlier, Pournouri set out to forbid his promoters from offering him alcohol, clearing out his minibar and focusing on his recovery. Problems worsened, however, when there were no crew to "keep tabs" on Bergling during his recuperation.[173] Pournouri met with Bergling's father Klas in 2014 to share concerns about Bergling's health.[14]

Against his client's wishes, Pournouri claimed to have cancelled two more world tours, which would have added up to approximately US$2.9 million in profits.[173]

    Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who travelled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress. When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be able to be happy and to do what he loved most – music. He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could now not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace. Tim was not made for the business machine he found himself in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned the spotlight. Tim, you will forever be loved and sadly missed. The person you were and your music will keep your memory alive. We love you, The Family

On 22 May, Bergling's family announced plans for a private funeral with "the people who were closest to him".[181] A funeral service was held on 8 June at the cemetery Skogskyrkogården in Stockholm.[182][183] He was buried at Hedvig Eleonora Church in June 2018.[184][185]

On 26 March 2019, Bergling's family launched a mental illness and suicide prevention foundation, named after the late DJ, the Tim Bergling Foundation. The foundation works internationally and aims to educate people and businesses on the issues surrounding suicide and mental health. The foundation also works to tackle climate change, manage business development, and conserve endangered species. Since 2019 people in the music industry are claiming Avicii's death has raised awareness of mental health in the industry.[222][223][224][225]
Music innovation

Avicii inspired many artists in the EDM genre, many of whom paid tribute to him after his death. Norwegian DJ Kygo cited Avicii as "[his] biggest inspiration and the reason why [he] started making electronic music."[226] In addition, artists like Alan Walker and DubVision described him as an "icon" in EDM.[227] Other artists such as Diplo, Sebastian Ingrosso, Felix Jaehn, and Martin Garrix, the last of whom collaborated with Avicii on his 2015 single "Waiting for Love", have also cited him as a source of inspiration, with the songs "Levels" and "Seek Bromance" being specifically mentioned as points of inspiration.[228]

On the day of his death, The Washington Post wrote an article citing Avicii as a pioneer artist in the attempt to bridge the gap between country and electronic music, crediting his 2013 hits "Wake Me Up" and "Hey Brother" as good examples of this movement.[229] Avicii is also credited for influencing other attempts at continuing this genre crossover, including songs such as Zedd's "The Middle" and Hailee Steinfeld's "Let Me Go".[230]

Avicii also influenced a number of mainstream artists outside electronic music. Nile Rodgers said that in terms of melody writing, Avicii was "maybe one of the best, if not the best I've ever worked with."[231] Mike Einziger of Incubus said "Some of the work we did together is some of the music I'm most proud of in my whole life."[232] Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons said "working with [Avicii] was one of my favorite collaborative moments."[233] Charlie Puth said that Avicii was "The man who really opened my eyes as to what my productions could one day sound like."[233] Eric Clapton, who never publicly worked with Avicii, said he was "Inspired by Avicii", and dedicated a song off his Christmas album, Happy Xmas, to him.[234]

On 21 November 2019, Billboard named Avicii's 2011 hit "Levels" as one of the one hundred songs which defined the 2010s,[235] whereas his 2013 hit "Wake Me Up" came 13th (and was the highest-charting EDM song[236][237]) on the Official Charts Company's chart of the decade.[238]

On 9 June 2020, it was announced that an Avicii Tribute Museum would open in Stockholm in the summer of 2021.[239] The renamed Avicii Experience was opened in February 2022 by Prince Carl Phillip and Princess Sofia, alongside Bergling's father Klas, in Space Stockholm, a new digital culture centre near Sergels torg.[240][241][242] The museum features reconstructions of Bergling's childhood bedroom and Los Angeles mansion, as well as offering recordings of Avicii's most popular work and the ability to remix them, as well as unreleased music.[241]

The museum was the idea of Bergling's parents, who wanted to give fans a place to remember and celebrate the work of their late son and learn about his process for creating music. The interactive museum also includes exhibitions from various stages in Bergling's life, including a simulation of the high-paced lifestyle he experienced before his retirement from touring in 2016, which are designed to give visitors an understanding of the health issues faced by the star. Exhibitions are also dedicated to raising the awareness of mental health problems in young people and the wider music industry.[243][244]
